provideocoalition.com
. Notable productions: many 2024–2025 festival and prestige films (SXSW 2025 had over half of features shot on Alexa 35
ymcinema.com
). Key reasons: Netflix-approved 4K sensor, Arri’s renowned color rendition, and compatibility with a vast range of lenses.

ARRI Alexa Mini LF (Digital) – Large-format (full-frame) Alexa in a compact body. Widely used on high-end features and streaming series since 2019 for its combination of the Alexa look with a lighter form factor. It became “vastly more popular…than the bigger Alexa LF” due to its small size
indepthcine.com
 – ideal for handheld, Steadicam, drone work without sacrificing image quality. Used on films like 1917 and Joker (partial) and many Netflix productions. Popular for its 4.5K resolution (Netflix compliance), beautiful shallow depth of field, and Arri reliability.

ARRI Alexa LF (Digital) – The original large-format Alexa (2018) with a full-frame sensor. Often paired with the Mini LF on big-budget features (the LF as studio camera and Mini LF for rigging). Captured films such as The Batman (2022) and Nomadland. Delivers the Alexa look with higher resolution; valued for its cinematic color and highlight handling. While the Mini LF overtook it in popularity, the Alexa LF remains a workhorse for large-format needs (Arri’s share of large-format cinema is significant even as Super35 still dominates
indepthcine.com
).

ARRI Alexa Mini (Original, Digital) – A Super 35 4K-ready (3.2K upsampled) camera released in 2015 that became “by far the most popular” camera in cinema through the late 2010s
indepthcine.com
. Used on countless films (e.g. Parasite, 1917 as secondary units) and prestige TV series. Its compact size and light weight allowed it to be used not just on gimbals but as A-cam for many productions
indepthcine.com
. Key features: the same revered Alexa sensor (ALEV III) in a tiny body – delivering Arri’s color science and dynamic range in any situation. Even by 2024 it “still dominates…with a slightly lower price and data rate,” though its share is now yielding to the 4K Alexa 35 on the high end
indepthcine.com
.

ARRI Alexa (Classic/XT/SXT Series, Digital) – The original Alexa Plus/XT and later SXT (2010–2017) that defined digital cinema’s look. Super 35 sensor (2.8K up to 3.4K) with unparalleled dynamic range and filmic color, used in an overwhelming number of Oscar-winning films in the 2010s. (Arri digital cameras were used on 72% of Sundance narrative films over 2018–2021
indepthcine.com
.) Though newer models have emerged, many mid-budget productions and commercials still use older Alexas for their “distinct and beautiful image quality”
arri.com
. Key feature: the gold-standard Arri color science and skin tones. Notable usage: films like Skyfall (Alexa Studio), The Revenant (XT), and numerous others that cemented Alexa as the industry standard.

ARRI Alexa 65 (Digital) – A 65mm sensor (wide-format) digital camera available through Arri Rental. Used for epic-scale imagery in films like Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame (the first blockbusters shot entirely with Alexa 65, in a custom IMAX-certified version
theasc.com
hollywoodreporter.com
) and in portions of The Revenant and Roma. Typical use: big-budget features seeking IMAX-level resolution and a huge field of view. Key features: 6.5K resolution from a 65 mm sensor, incredibly high image quality and low noise. Its large format aesthetic and stunning detail are popular for VFX-heavy films and awe-inspiring vistas. (Note: Alexa 65 is rental-only, making it exclusive to top-tier productions.)

ARRI Amira (Digital) – A documentary-focused sibling to the Alexa (2014) with the same Super 35 sensor in a versatile ENG-style body. Widely used for high-end docs, television and reality series – anywhere the Alexa look is wanted in a run-and-gun form. Many nature docs and factual programs adopted the Amira. It records superior 2K/4K ProRes images with minimal setup. Its popularity stems from Arri’s image quality in a one-person-operable package. (In general, documentary productions tend to feature more Sony/Canon cameras at lower budgets
indepthcine.com
, but the Amira remains a favorite for premium documentaries needing the Alexa look.)

Panavision Millennium DXL2 (Digital) – Panavision’s flagship large-format digital camera (2018) developed with a RED Monstro 8K sensor and Panavision color science. Used on high-end features such as Mulan (2020) and Star Wars: The Mandalorian (virtual production plates). It offers 8K RAW capture with 16-bit color
panavision.com
, and is usually rented with Panavision’s unparalleled lens sets. Typical use: big productions requiring 8K resolution and Panavision’s custom tonal adjustments. Key reasons for popularity: the combination of Panavision’s lens heritage and a top-tier sensor, plus in-camera color profile (“Light Iron Color”) tuned for cinematic skin tones. (Note: DXL2 is rental-only; it succeeded the original DXL introduced in 2016.)

Sony VENICE (Digital) – Sony’s high-end full-frame digital cinema camera (2018) that quickly became the second most dominant camera in high-end productions after Arri
indepthcine.com
. It features a 6K sensor (updated to 6K/4K output) with excellent color and dual native ISO, and is approved by Netflix. VENICE has been used in many feature films (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood used VENICE for nighttime scenes) and prestige series (The Crown Season 3+, The Mandalorian Season 1 backgrounds). Known for its “rich color, 6K resolution and film-like skin tones,” it often comes in just behind Alexa in DP preferences. By 2023 it even led camera usage on Emmy-nominated series
ymcinema.com
. Key features: full-frame look, strong low-light performance, internal ND filters, and the “Rialto” tethered sensor extension for tight spaces – all making it a versatile A-camera.

Sony VENICE 2 (Digital) – The 2022 update to the Venice with a new 8.6K full-frame sensor (or 5K S35 mode) and internal X-OCN recording. It offers 16+ stops dynamic range and improved dual base ISOs
abelcine.com
. Already approved by Netflix and used on major 2024 productions, it continues Venice’s popularity in large-format cinematography. For example, the film The Creator (2023) opted for a smaller camera, but many other large productions (and virtually all Netflix in-house films) use Venice or Venice 2 for true 4K+ capture. DPs choose Venice 2 for its combination of resolution, color fidelity, and the familiarity of Sony’s workflow.

Sony PXW-FX9 (Digital) – A full-frame 6K sensor camera (downsample to 4K) released 2019, popular in documentary and television drama production. The FX9 (successor to the FS7) offers a cinematic look with run-and-gun ergonomics. It’s used in streaming and cable series that need 4K but with a smaller crew – for example, some episodes of documentaries and unscripted shows. Notable for its fast autofocus and dual base ISO, it’s praised in doc circles for full-frame shallow depth on a budget. Key features: internal 4K recording, interchangeable E-mount lenses, and reliable electronic ND filter for quickly adapting to changing light.

Sony PXW-FS7 / FS7 II (Digital) – The ubiquitous documentary camera of the late 2010s. A Super 35 4K camera (2014) that became a mainstay for docs, TV news magazines, and low-budget series. Many documentaries at Sundance and beyond were shot on FS7 for its balance of image quality, 10-bit 4:2:2 recording, and affordability. It remains widely used in 2025 in documentary/reality even as newer models arise. Typical use: handheld vérité shooting, interviews, TV run-and-gun. Often cited for its ergonomic design and robust codec. (Documentary surveys indicate a strong presence of Sony cameras like FS7/FX9 in recent years
indepthcine.com
.) Even though newer models exist, the FS7’s image (and later FS7 II) still satisfies broadcasters and streamers for 4K delivery.

Sony FX6 (Digital) – A compact full-frame cinema camera (2020) used in documentaries, indie films and as a B-camera on larger sets. It shares the Venice/FX9 sensor technology (4K full-frame) in a smaller body suited for gimbals, vehicle mounts, or solo operators. Example use: nature docs (due to its excellent low-light and small size for remote locations) and music videos. Often paired with FX9 or Venice to capture angles in tight spots. Its popularity stems from delivering “Venice-like color in a tiny package,” with dual native ISO for low light and a price point accessible to owner-operators.

Sony CineAlta PMW-F55 (Digital) – Sony’s earlier 4K cinema camera (2013) that saw heavy use in mid-2010s TV and films. It shot series like Breaking Bad (final episodes), Better Call Saul, The Crown (S1–2), and many network TV dramas. With a global shutter and 4K RAW capability, the F55 was a reliable workhorse. By 2025 it’s largely retired from top-tier jobs (surpassed by Venice), but some productions still use it for its robust build and proven track record. Key features: 4K Super 35 sensor, global shutter (no rolling artifacts), and modular design. It helped establish 4K acquisition in television. (Sony’s overall share of high-end productions was about 12–14% through early 2020s
indepthcine.com
images.squarespace-cdn.com
, thanks largely to cameras like the F55 and Venice.)

Sony BURANO (Digital) – A brand-new (2023) CineAlta camera with an 8.6K full-frame sensor, essentially a “little Venice.” Designed for solo operators and documentaries, it has an interchangeable E-mount/PL-mount and in-body image stabilization – a first for a cinema camera
omegabroadcast.com
. Burano is quickly being adopted for high-end docuseries and as a versatile B-cam on drama sets. It inherits Venice 2’s image quality (16 stops DR) in a lighter body with electronic ND filters. The Burano addresses the demand for a “Netflix-approved” camera between the FX9 and Venice, and is expected to become a go-to for documentaries and TV in 2024+.

Panasonic VariCam 35 (Digital) – Panasonic’s Super 35 4K cinema camera (2014) that found a niche in episodic TV (one of the first Netflix-approved cameras). It shot shows like Orange Is the New Black and The Deuce. Known for its dual native ISO and “Panasonic look” (slightly cooler color science), it offered reliable 4K at a time Arri was limited to 2.8K. While not as common as Arri or Sony, the Varicam 35 proved itself in low-light and on-set workflows (with its modular recorder). By 2025, fewer productions use it, but it paved the way for Panasonic’s reputation in 4K TV production. Key features: Dual-ISO (800/5000) for flexible lighting, and an ergonomic design favored by some operators.

Panasonic VariCam LT (Digital) – A lighter, smaller version of the Varicam (2015) with the same sensor. Used for documentaries, indie films, and as a crash-cam on larger sets requiring 4K. For example, some action scenes and car rigs on Netflix shows used the LT where a full Varicam or Alexa was too large. It maintains the dual-ISO ability. Popular for its comparatively lower cost and compact size while still delivering broadcast-approved 4K image quality.

Canon EOS C300 Mark II (Digital) – Canon’s Super 35 workhorse (2015) that became very popular in documentary and television. Shoots 4K internally with Canon’s acclaimed color science and skin tones. Throughout the late 2010s, the C300 II was a go-to for docs, interviews, and independent films, appreciated for its plug-and-play usability. Many lower-budget Netflix documentaries and NatGeo docs were filmed on C300 series. It offers Canon Log profiles for wide dynamic range. Typical use: one-man interview setups, reality TV (for its autofocus), and any scenario where ease of use and a pleasing image out of camera were paramount.

Canon EOS C300 Mark III (Digital) – Released 2020 with an updated Super 35 DGO sensor (Dual Gain Output) for ~16 stops dynamic range. This camera continues the C300 line in high-end documentary and TV – offering improved low-light and 120fps slow-motion at 4K. Some recent documentary films and series (especially those wanting a small crew and Canon’s reliable Dual Pixel AF) have switched to the C300 III. It maintains the reputation for “Canon color” – natural skin tones that need minimal grading. Often used alongside Canon’s C70 or C500 II for multi-cam shoots.

Canon EOS C500 Mark II (Digital) – Canon’s full-frame cinema camera (2019) providing 5.9K resolution. It combines a large sensor look with a compact form, making it popular for indie features and streaming movies. Notably, the Netflix film Citation was shot on C500 II with Canon Sumire primes
businessday.ng
. Use cases: narrative projects that want full-frame depth of field on a budget, and documentaries where its full-frame + autofocus capabilities shine (some wildlife shooters use C500 II for its low-light performance). Key features: internal RAW recording, Dual Pixel AF, and that wide Canon color gamut. It’s often chosen for the “organic” look of Canon color science in a high-resolution full-frame image.

Canon EOS C700 FF (Digital) – Canon’s high-end full-frame cinema camera (2018) aimed at top-tier productions. Though less commercially successful, it was used in select projects (e.g. Free Solo’s mountain climb sequences were shot on a C700 with a global shutter for dynamic scenes). It offers a 5.9K full-frame sensor, modular design, and could output RAW to Codex. Netflix approved, it targeted the same space as Arri or Sony for features, but saw limited adoption. Key features: global shutter sensor option (unique at this level), and compatibility with a broad range of cine accessories. In practice, it’s a rarity on sets – but when used, it’s for specialized needs like zero rolling-shutter distortion or extreme conditions (its build is very rugged).

Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 4.6K G2 (Digital) – Blackmagic Design’s affordable cinema camera (2019) that has been popular with independent filmmakers and as a crash camera on bigger sets. It provides 4.6K raw recording in a Super 35 sensor with 15 stops of dynamic range at a fraction of the cost of rivals. While rarely an “A-cam” on major studio films, it has been used on portions of projects (for instance, some action inserts or second-unit shots) and on many music videos and low-budget features. Filmmakers appreciate its Blackmagic RAW codec for manageable file sizes and a pleasing color science (leaning toward a high dynamic range look). Key reason for popularity: price-to-performance – it democratized high-quality 4K filmmaking.

Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 12K (Digital) – An innovative 12K resolution camera (2020) used in specialty cases where extreme resolution or reframing is needed. For example, some VFX plates and virtual production backgrounds have been captured with the URSA 12K. It made a surprise appearance in high-end TV: at the 2023 Emmys, one nominee series even employed the URSA 12K
ymcinema.com
. The camera’s 12K S35 sensor can produce oversampled 8K or 4K with superb detail, which is useful for IMAX documentaries or large-format VFX shots. Key features: an impressive 12,288×6480 sensor with 14 stops DR, yet it uses Blackmagic RAW to keep file sizes reasonable. Its popularity is limited but growing in niche uses where resolution is king (and indeed its presence in prestige productions signals that even unconventional brands are finding a place
ymcinema.com
).

Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K (Digital) – A compact S35 camera (2019) with 6K resolution, highly popular among indie filmmakers, music videographers, and as a body-mounted or POV camera in bigger productions. While not typically a primary camera on large features, the Pocket 6K (and 6K Pro) have been used for unique shots due to their tiny size and relatively high image quality. (E.g., a small interior car shot or a stunt rig might use a Pocket 6K where an Alexa Mini is too costly to risk.) It offers 13+ stops of dynamic range and Blackmagic RAW/ProRes recording. Filmmakers love it for getting a cinematic image under tight budget or space constraints. Notable use: indie films on the festival circuit often cite the BMPCC 6K for its film-like color and affordability.

Film Cameras (35mm, 65mm & 16mm)

Despite the digital era, film cameras continue to be used in many influential productions for their unique aesthetic. In fact, film experienced a bit of a revival in the 2020s, with several Oscar-nominated cinematographers returning to 35mm and 65mm

.

ARRICAM ST (35 mm Film) – Arri’s flagship Studio 35mm camera (introduced 2000) known for its quiet operation and precision. Along with the lighter LT, the Arricam ST represents the pinnacle of 35mm tech. In 2024, for the first time, ARRICAM cameras topped the Oscars camera usage – beating out digital models
ymcinema.com
. Films like Oppenheimer (2023, partially) and Poor Things (2024) used Arricam for their main unit. Typical use: high-end dramas and auteurs’ projects preferring film’s organic look. Key features: pin-registered movement (steady images), quiet sync-sound blimp, and compatibility with modern lens control. The Arricam ST is chosen for studio and tripod work (where its size is manageable) to deliver that unmistakable 35mm cinematic texture.

ARRICAM LT (35 mm Film) – The Lite version of the Arricam, optimized for handheld and Steadicam with a smaller form factor. It shares the ST’s impeccable image quality. Productions often use ST and LT in tandem (the LT for handheld/Steadicam scenes, ST for studio shots). For instance, The Fabelmans (2022) and The French Dispatch (2021) were shot on Arricam LT/ST packages. The LT’s appeal lies in bringing the 35mm film look to more dynamic camera work. It’s slightly louder than ST, but lighter. Recent notable usage: The Brutalist (upcoming) reportedly used Arricam LT/ST, highlighting how even in 2025, modern films use these cameras extensively
dvxuser.com
. Simply put, the Arricam LT provides portability without sacrificing that authentic film image.

ARRIFLEX 435 (35 mm Film) – A high-speed 35mm camera beloved for slow-motion and action sequences on film. The 435 can shoot up to 150 fps, making it ideal for sports, explosions, and any time dilation effects in movies. Although introduced in the 1990s, it remains a go-to for directors shooting film who need overcrank capabilities. e.g. Christopher Nolan has utilized the 435 for high-FPS sequences in his film work (when not using IMAX). Typical use: second-unit photography for action movies, slow-motion inserts in music videos on film. Key features: rock-steady registration even at high speeds and an orientable viewfinder that’s useful for creative camera angles. The 435 is essentially the slow-motion king of film cameras, and many film productions keep one on hand for the shots where only 35mm can capture the desired motion rendering.

ARRIFLEX 235 (35 mm Film) – A lightweight, compact 35mm camera for handheld and rig work (launched 2003). It’s smaller even than the Arricam LT, often used for vehicle mounts, Steadicam, or any scenario requiring mobility with a film camera. For example, chase scenes or cramped interior shots on film might employ a 235 to get the camera in tight spaces. It has a mirrored reflex shutter like other Arri film cams and can take 200-ft mags for minimal size. While not as commonly used as Arricam, it fills a niche: providing the 35mm look in “impossible” places. Notable use: Creed (2015) employed an Arriflex 235 with a hand-crank for a stylized flashback scene
filmmakermagazine.com
, demonstrating its versatility for creative effects. Key feature: extreme portability in a 35mm form.

ARRIFLEX 416 (16 mm Film) – A modern Super 16 camera (2006) celebrated for bringing Arri’s advanced design to the 16mm format. It’s quiet, can shoot up to 75 fps, and is Super 16 (meaning widescreen 16:9 capable). The 416 (and 416 Plus) saw a resurgence as some filmmakers in the 2020s chose 16mm for its gritty texture – e.g. portions of Nope (2022) were on 16mm, and The Fabelmans even used an ARRI 416 Plus for home-movie style sequences
soc.org
. Many indie films and music videos also love the 16mm aesthetic, and the 416 is the best tool for it. Key reasons for popularity: extremely steady and sharp for a 16mm camera, relatively quiet for sync sound, and compatibility with modern accessories. In short, it offers the “film look” with more grain and a nostalgic feel – a creative choice that’s become trendy again for storytellers.

Panavision Panaflex Millennium XL2 (35 mm Film) – Panavision’s flagship 35mm camera (released 2004) and one of the most widely used film cameras for Hollywood studio productions. Spielberg’s The Fabelmans (2022) was shot on the Millennium XL2
ymcinema.com
, as are many of Spielberg and Tarantino’s films. It’s prized for being relatively small and lightweight for a 35mm (12 lbs body) and for Panavision’s ultra-smooth movement and lens ecosystem. “The XL2 is Panavision’s most popular 35mm camera”, even seen branded with LA Lakers colors in one Instagram post
instagram.com
. Typical use: any top-tier film production, especially when using Panavision anamorphic lenses. Key features: reflex viewing system, 2–4 perf capability, and a reputation for reliability. DPs choose the XL2 for that classic Panavision feel – it’s the successor to the Gold and Platinum, incorporating faster electronics and video assist.

Panavision Panaflex Platinum (35 mm Film) – The predecessor to the XL, the Platinum (1986) is still in circulation for those who love its mechanics. Many ’90s and early 2000s films were shot on the Platinum. In 2025, it might appear in productions either as a spare body or for cinematographers who have used it for decades and request it. It’s a studio camera known for rock-solid registration and compatibility with Panavision’s vast lens library. Key difference from XL2: slightly larger and heavier, and without some of the ergonomic tweaks. Nonetheless, it produces gorgeous images. Some filmmakers intentionally use older Panaflexes to achieve a certain retro workflow or look. The Platinum remains a testament to Panavision’s enduring build quality.

Panavision System 65 (65 mm Film) – Panavision’s 65mm film cameras (such as the System 65 Studio and Handheld 65 HR) for 5-perf 65mm production. These were used in rare large-format film projects – e.g. The Master (2012) and Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight (2015) employed Panavision 65mm cameras and vintage Ultra Panavision lenses
in70mm.com
. Typical use: prestige projects seeking the ultimate image quality on film, often for epic or period stories. The 65mm negative (5 perf) gives 2× the resolution of 35mm and a very shallow depth of field. Key features: extremely high detail and a unique, creamy rendition of tones. Panavision maintains a small fleet of these cameras. They are cumbersome and expensive to run, but the visual result – a la Lawrence of Arabia style – is unparalleled. As of 2025, such cameras are rare but still occasionally brought out for films that want that 65mm grandeur.

IMAX 65 mm (15-perf) Cameras (Film) – The 65mm 15-perforation IMAX film cameras, known for the gigantic 70 mm film frames (about 3× the size of standard 65mm). Directors like Christopher Nolan and Jordan Peele have used IMAX MSM 9802 and MKII cameras for feature sequences. For instance, Nolan’s Oppenheimer (2023) was shot almost entirely on 65mm, including IMAX 15-perf for action scenes
nextbestpicture.com
. Typical use: tentpole films for IMAX theatrical release, where select sequences (or the whole film) are filmed in IMAX to be projected on the largest screens. Key features: stunning resolution and image area, but very loud and heavy (thus often used for exteriors and action, not intimate dialogue). IMAX film cameras remain the gold standard for image quality in analog cinematography, providing an immersive experience that some filmmakers argue is still superior in feel to any digital format.

Aaton XTR Prod (16 mm Film) – A legendary 16mm camera (1980s) famous among documentary and indie filmmakers for its ergonomic “cat on the shoulder” design. While the ARRI 416 now surpasses it technically, many cinematographers still have a soft spot for Aaton 16mm cameras. The XTR Prod is sync-sound and relatively quiet, widely used in the ’90s and 2000s for docs and art-house films. Even in the 2020s, one might find an Aaton XTR or LTR on a student film or a music video set for a grainy aesthetic. Key features: ergonomic handheld design, video tap, and crystal sync. Its presence in modern cinema is niche, but as film resurges, a few DPs are dusting off Aatons to achieve a retro documentary look that is hard to fake digitally. (For example, some portions of Euphoria on HBO were reportedly shot on 16mm – an environment where an Aaton could have been used, though Arri 416 is more likely.)

Specialty & Emerging Cameras

These cameras fill special roles – from ultra slow-motion shots to drone aerials to novel compact systems – and have become common tools in modern productions:

Vision Research Phantom Flex4K (Digital High-Speed) – The industry-standard high-speed camera for super slow-motion. The Phantom Flex4K can shoot up to 1000 fps at 4K and higher at lower resolutions. It’s frequently used in action films, commercials (for liquid & explosion shots), and nature documentaries (to capture animals in slow mo). For instance, The Hurt Locker (2008) notably used Phantom cameras for its explosive ordnance scenes
nextbestpicture.com
. In modern use, a blockbuster might film an explosion or debris shot with a Phantom to then intercut with regular footage. Key features: ability to buffer a few seconds of footage in RAM, capturing blink-and-you-miss-it moments in incredible detail. The Flex4K’s image is clean and detailed, making slow-motion dramatic and crystal clear – a reason it’s a staple on set whenever slow-mo is needed.

GoPro HERO Series (Action Camera) – GoPro cameras (e.g. HERO10, HERO11) are often used for point-of-view shots, stunt work, and any scenario where a tiny rugged camera can be thrown into harm’s way. They are extremely common as crash cams on big sets – from being strapped to cars flipping over, to mounting on actors for unique POV angles. An example: the entire film Hardcore Henry (2015) was shot with GoPro Hero3 units to create a first-person perspective
en.wikipedia.org
. In many action movies, you’ll find a few frames from a GoPro during a dangerous stunt (for instance, a car’s undercarriage view as it jumps, etc.). Typical use cases also include documentaries (for underwater or extreme sports) and reality TV. Key features: very wide angle, 4K/5K resolution in a tiny form, and robustness. While the footage quality differs from cinema cameras, in post-production it can be stabilized and graded to fit in. The GoPro’s popularity in professional production lies in its ability to capture angles no other camera can, at virtually no risk to crew.

DJI Inspire 2 + Zenmuse X7 (Aerial Drone Camera) – The DJI Inspire 2 drone with the Zenmuse X7 camera (Super 35 sensor, 6K RAW) became the workhorse for aerial cinematography in the late 2010s. It has captured stunning aerial sequences in films and series across the world. Many productions use the Inspire 2 for establishing shots, chase scenes from above, and landscape panoramas – it offers near-cinema-quality imagery from a flying platform at a relatively low cost. Key features: 6K CinemaDNG/ProRes from a stabilized gimbal, interchangeable lenses, and easy deployment. A notable example: the drone shots in Netflix’s The Witcher and HBO’s Game of Thrones (later seasons) were done with similar drone systems. As of 2025, the newer Inspire 3 (with an 8K full-frame sensor) is entering service
youtube.com
, offering even higher quality – but the Inspire 2/X7 combo remains widely used on current productions for reliable 5.2K footage. Drones like these have made aerials so accessible that virtually every big production includes some drone shots, formerly only achievable by helicopter.

DJI Ronin 4D (Digital Gimbal Camera) – An innovative 4-axis integrated gimbal camera system (released 2021 in 6K, and 2022 in 8K). The Ronin 4D combines a full-frame camera (DJI Zenmuse X9) with a built-in stabilizer, allowing cinematographers to get ultra-smooth tracking shots without a separate Steadicam. Its recent use in television has turned heads – e.g., the Emmy-winning series “Adolescence” utilized the Ronin 4D with Cooke lenses, showcasing its capability on high-end sets
ymcinema.com
. It even won a Technical Emmy award for its engineering
dji.com
. Typical use: complex oners and motion-heavy scenes where a small stabilizer can roam (e.g. chase scenes through tight interiors). Key features: 4-axis stabilization (including Z-axis to remove footsteps), LiDAR autofocus, and internal ProRes RAW recording. The Ronin 4D represents a new category – in 2025 it’s still novel, but its surprise presence among top productions
ymcinema.com
 signals that this all-in-one camera may shape future filmmaking, especially for indie projects aiming for high-end camera movement on a budget.

Kinefinity MAVO Edge 8K (Digital) – A Chinese-made large-format 8K cinema camera (2020) that has started making inroads in professional circles. It boasts a full-frame 8K sensor, 14+ stops of dynamic range, internal ProRes RAW, all at a competitive price. In a notable development, a 2023 Emmy-nominated show reportedly employed the MAVO Edge 8K – a first for Kinefinity on such a stage
ymcinema.com
. Typical uses so far: indie films, commercials, and some TV drama in Asia and Europe. DPs who use it cite its great value and image quality that rivals more established brands. Key features: 8K resolution for under $12k, compact body, and multi-format aspect ratio support (open-gate, anamorphic modes). While not yet mainstream, its inclusion in high-profile productions shows that emerging camera manufacturers can deliver the goods. The MAVO Edge’s popularity is rising among those willing to step outside the Arri/Red/Sony box and leverage a high-spec camera with a fresh color science.

Z CAM E2 Series (e.g. E2-F6) – (Digital) – Z CAM’s line of modular cinema cameras (from MFT 4K models to full-frame 6K/8K models) became a favorite of some indie creators for their small size and capable sensors. The E2-F6 (full-frame 6K) and E2-S6 (Super 35 6K) in particular offer high quality at low cost. Impressively, the Best Picture Oscar winner Nomadland (2020) even used a Z CAM (E2-F8) for certain scenes, leveraging its tiny form factor to shoot in real Amazon warehouses unobtrusively

. Typical use: guerrilla-style filmmaking, VR rigs (multiple Z CAMs), or as POV/crash cams on bigger sets (where their interchangeable lens mount and decent dynamic range give an edge over GoPros). Key features: very compact cube design, up to 6K or 8K resolution, and options to record ProRes or RAW. While not a common A-cam on large productions, Z CAMs have proved their worth for filmmakers who need to squeeze a cinema-grade image out of a camera that can fit in a coat pocket.

Panasonic Lumix DC-S1H (Mirrorless Digital) – A full-frame mirrorless camera (2019) that was notably the first mirrorless approved by Netflix for original productions
facebook.com
. The S1H shoots 6K/4K in 10-bit with a dual-native ISO sensor and has been used as a crash cam or discreet camera on some Netflix shows (where its small size and 6K quality met the stringent requirements). For example, certain tight shots in The Witcher used the S1H when a larger camera couldn’t be deployed. It’s also popular with documentary and indie filmmakers who need a lightweight setup with high image quality – especially due to its strong in-body stabilization for handheld work. Key features: full-frame 24 MP sensor with Venus Engine color processing, variety of recording formats (including anamorphic 4:3 modes), and robust build. The S1H proved that hybrid cameras can play in the cinema field, and it paved the way for others (like the Canon EOS R5C) to follow for professional use.

Canon EOS C70 (Digital) – A compact cinema camera (2020) with a Super 35 DGO sensor (same tech as C300 III) in a DSLR-style body. It garnered attention after being added to Netflix’s approved list
youtube.com
, meaning it could be used on 4K productions for tight shots or even as main camera on docs. The C70 has found a niche in documentary series and news-oriented filmmaking – offering cinema camera quality with the convenience of built-in ND filters and Canon’s renowned autofocus in a portable package. For instance, a crew could easily carry a couple of C70s while traveling and still meet Netflix 4K standards. Key features: 4K 120fps, reliable Dual Pixel AF, and an RF lens mount enabling use of both new RF lenses and adapted cinema glass. Its popularity is due to versatility – bridging the gap between mirrorless and cinema camera, it’s equally at home mounting on a gimbal or shooting an interview solo.

Sony α7S III / FX3 (Mirrorless Digital) – Sony’s full-frame mirrorless line known for exceptional low-light. The α7S III (2020) and its cinema-bodied twin FX3 (2021) share a 12 MP sensor with dual native ISO that can practically see in the dark. These cameras made a huge splash in 2023 when The Creator – a $80M sci-fi film – was shot almost entirely on the FX3, including IMAX presentations
youtube.com
britishcinematographer.co.uk
. This demonstrated that even a “prosumer” camera could deliver theatrical results. Typical uses beyond that case: the α7S/FX3 are often used for night documentary footage (e.g. wildlife at night, where ISO 409,600 might capture what other cameras cannot) and as lightweight gimbal cams on set. They’re also common for behind-the-scenes crews. Key features: full-frame 4K up to 120 fps, phenomenal low-light with usable ISO into the tens of thousands, and a minimal form factor. In The Creator, the filmmakers lauded the FX3’s “extremely high sensitivity… able to get a great exposure in full moonlight”
britishcinematographer.co.uk
, and its light weight enabling them to shoot for long takes handheld
britishcinematographer.co.uk
. The inclusion of an FX3 in a major IMAX film underscores its capability. In sum, the α7S III/FX3 has become the go-to for extreme low-light and run-and-gun scenarios, proving that in 2025, even consumer-bodied cameras have a firm place in professional cinema.

Each of these cameras – whether a dominant digital system like the Alexa Mini or a classic film workhorse like the Arricam – contributes to the diverse toolkit of modern cinematography. The choice of camera depends on the project’s artistic needs, budget, and logistical demands. From Arri’s near-universal presence at the high end

 to the resurgence of celluloid in prestige productions

, it’s clear that filmmakers today have a richer selection than ever to achieve their vision.
